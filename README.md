## Inspiration

I developed this fullstack social media web app to hone my knowledge of the MERN stack along with Next.js. Initially, I decided to go with Next's default server option. Then, I went with the custom Express server since that allowed me to use WebSockets (Socket.io) in my app for realtime chats. Besides, this is a simple social media web app.

Please give this repository a ‚≠ê if you liked this app. It seems like a little thing, but it helps a lot with the motivation.
